# Kaggle-challenge-team-2

A group assignment where students will participate in a mock Kaggle Challenge. Each team is tasked to develop a statistical/machine learning model, and will submit the results of their model to Kaggle to obtain a score. Teams will also present their findings in a group presentation. Team will work together to create a collaborative research environment using GitHub and Google Colab, explore and visualise the data, build a pipeline to pre-process the dataset, train a viable model and customize it.

The Kaggle Challenge required for this assignment is here: Spaceship Titanic. Predict which passengers of The Spaceship Titanic, an interstellar passenger liner, were transported by a spacetime anomaly using records recovered from the spaceshipâ€™s damaged computer system.
